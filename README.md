# factory²

This is a proof-of-concept for a factory factory (factory²) for randomized structured objects. I am tired of writing of whole bunch of factories, most of which share the same properties and same set of fixture data. With this library, you can define your model simply in terms of keys and well-known fixture data. You can use the included fixture data, or register your own mapping between symbols and data sets.
